<h3>Scientific challenges</h3>
<p>Antibiotic discovery is has special challenges. Antibiotics must attack multiple target species that change over time, by developing resistance, and must do this in multiple body compartments.<span class="citation"><sup>2</sup></span> The developer of a new antibiotic must guess what resistance problems will be a greater problem in 5-10 years, and develop the drug to overcome this problem that still isn’t fully understood. An This flexibility and risk is not required in other therapeutic areas such as hypertension, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease where the drugs bind to one specific target. Even for cancer chemotherapy, which develops resistance to therapy, is not transmissible to other cancers or patients.Antibiotics must also be remarkable non-toxic, as their daily dosages often measured in grams are often higher that for other pharmaceutics measured in milligrams.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the antibiotics used today belong to classes of drugs discovered before 1970. They are products of a “golden age” of discovery from 1945-1965, which screened natural products from soil streptomyces and fungi. This discovery approach hit the law of diminishing returns y the 1960’s with the same classes (especially tetracyclines) being repeatably rediscovered.<span class="citation"><sup>2</sup></span> Since 1970, the only new antibiotic classes to reach the marked are the oxazolidinones (i.e. linezolid discovered in 1978 launched in 2000) and lipopeptides (discovered in 1986 launched in 2003). Most advances since the 1970s have come through improvements within antibiotic classes yielding analogues with increased potency and greater ability to evade existing resistance. However, over time this approach has become even more difficult with the emergence of resistance given resistance to the entire class of antibiotics such as KPC carbapenemases that compromises nearly all beta-lactams, 16srRNA methylases that impact all aminoglycosides, and up-regulation of efflux pumps that affects multiple antibiotics classes.</p>
<p>Given the sense that the limits of existing antibiotic classes had already been discovered by screening soil organisms, the pharmaceutical industry turned to genomics-based antibiotic discovery in the 1990s.<span class="citation"><sup>2</sup></span> The approach used genomic sequence data from several pathogens to identify conserved genes encoding targets not found in mammalian cells, and then run high-throughput screens of existing compound libraries to identify “druggable” molecules for these targets. Natural product screening was abandoned, partly because it had ceased to identify new leads, was expensive and time consuming, and it fitted poorly with the changing logistics of high-throughput screening.</p>
<p>In summary genomics-based discovery proved notable for its disappointments despite huge early enthusiasm and investment.</p>

<div class="blue">
<p>From 1995 to 2002, SmithKline Beecham (now part of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) identified 300 potential targets and ran 67 high-throughput screens, each of 260,000 – 530,000 compounds.<span class="citation"><sup>3</sup></span> Sixteen screens led to ‘hits’—meaning compounds that bound selectively to a target giving a reproducible antimicrobial activity in assays—and five of these translated into ‘lead’ compounds. The five corresponding targets, two (FabI9and Mrs) were not universally essential or conserved, meaning that they could not form the targets of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and it proved impossible to incorporate ‘drug-like properties’ into molecules that bound two others. The final target identified was peptide deformylase, for which GSK now has a molecule (GSK 1322322) in Phase II trials, although this did not come from high-throughput screening. This performance appears typical of other companies that followed the genomics strategy. Thus, 20 years after its advent, no antibiotic developed by this approach has reached the market</p>
