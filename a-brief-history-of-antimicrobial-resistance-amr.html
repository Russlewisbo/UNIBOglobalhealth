<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> A brief history of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)</h1>
<p>Until the 20th Century, influenza, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and enteric infections were among the top four causes of death. The average life expectancy of adults in Western Europe was less than 50 years (Fig 1), and 2% of children failed to live beyond 5 years of age due to deaths caused by infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Industrialization and growing wealth during the 19th century brought improvements in drinking water and sanitation in many countries, reducing communicable enteric infections and improvements in life expectancy. By the early 20th century, advances in immunization led to the introduction of vaccines for pertussis, diptheria, yellow fever and tuberculosis. However, common bacterial infections remained a common cause of death. Streptococcal throat infections were sometimes fatal, ear infections could lead to deafness, mastoiditis or meningitis with a 90% mortality rate, and surgery or childbirth was associated with high complication rates and frequent maternal deaths.</p>

<p>Products with antimicrobial activity had been used for millennia to treat infections even if the causes of infection were not known until the 19th and 20th centuries. The microbiologist and immunologist Paul Erlich (1854-1915) is credited with the discovery and first medical application of a synthetic antibiotic arsphenamine (Salvarsan) in the treatment of bacterial infection- syphilis. However, it was the serendipitous discovery of penicillin on September 3, 1928 by Alexander Fleming, and its subsequent purification of the drug in quantities needed for clinical testing in humans by Drs. Florey and Chain in the late 1930s, that lead to the major breakthrough of antibiotic treatment for common bacterial infections. Alexander Fleming was also among the first physicians to caution about the risks of resistance to penicillin if used too little or for a too short of period during treatment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is not difficult to make microbes resistant to penicillin in the laboratory by exposing them to concentrations not sufficient to kill them, and the same thing has occasionally happened in the body. The time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily under-dose himself and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug make them resistant.” -Sir Alexander Fleming, Nobel Prize Lecture, December 11, 1945</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By 1947, Fleming’s predictions were realized as the first cases of penicillin resistance reported. Thus began the “arms race” between the “emergence” and spread of new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and discovery of new antibiotics to treat these resistant pathogens. Initially, antibiotic discovery seemed to keep pace with resistance as a host of new chemical classes were developed and introduced in the 1950s-1980’s. During this time, it was often possible to simply switch treatment once resistance against a specific antibiotic became a major problem. By the 1980’s the discovery of new agents began to slow (Fig 2). The latest discovery of a new antibiotic class that has reached the market was in 1987. Since then, there has been a lack of innovation in the field, and today there are few novel antibiotic classes in the drug pipeline. In Module 2 we will examine the scientific challenges and market forces that have made new antibiotic discovery increasingly difficult and how access to newer antibiotics is limited in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>Once resistance has developed, it can spread from a colonised patient to another patient if appropriate hygienic precautions (e.g., hand hygiene, isolation) are not taken. The risk of resistant bacteria spreading is amplified in crowded environments, especially when people in the surrounding area are receiving antibiotics - a common situation in hospitals and other healthcare facilities.</p>
<p>The consequences of faltering antibiotic discovery are now seen worldwide as more and more bacterial infections are becoming harder to treat again. Especially worrisome is the lack of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria. The rapid global spread of multi- and pan-resistant bacteria, also known in the lay press as “superbugs,” can cause infections that are not treatable with existing antibiotics.</p>

<p>Recognizing the growing global threat of antibiotic resistance (AMR) on human health but also the economy and human development, The World Health Organization (WHO) and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) proposed as a <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241509763">Global Action Plan for AMR</a> in 2017 and more recently a <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/30-07-2021-call-to-action-on-antimicrobial-resistance-2021">“Call to Action on Antimicrobial Resistance”</a> in 2021. The plan outlines 21 strategies and 5 strategic objectives action plans that should be implemented in member states to address AMR. These include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Improvements in the awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training</li>
<li>Strengthening of knowledge and evidence base of AMR through surveillance and research</li>
<li>Reductions in the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures</li>
<li>Optimization the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health</li>
<li>Development of an economic case for sustainable investment in AMR research that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions</li>
</ol>
<p>The WHO also published a <a href="https://www.who.int/medicines/publications/WHO-PPL-Short_Summary_25Feb-ET_NM_WHO.pdf">Priority Pathogen List</a> for research and development of new antibiotics (Table 1). This priority list includes bacterial pathogens that are considered to be be the biggest threat to human health in addition to <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</em> The WHO list breaks down pathogens into three groups:</p>

<p>These pathogens may exhibit multi-drug resistance (MDR), extensive drug resistance (XDR) or pan-drug resistance (PDR)<span class="citation">(1)</span>. Difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR) is a newer definition used to define isolate resistance patterns that require the use of less-effective or more toxic “reserve” antibiotics- e.g., <em>Acinetobacter baumanii</em> susceptible only to colistin and tobramycin <span class="citation">(2)</span>.</p>
<div class="blue">
<p>MDR- resistance to one agent in at least 3 antibiotic categories; XDR- resistant except to 2 or fewer antibiotic categories; PDR- resistant to all agents in all antibiotic categories; DTR-requires the use of less-effective or more toxic “reserve” antibiotics</p>
</div>
<p>Currently, both the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/312266/9789241515528-eng.pdf">WHO</a> and <a href="https://www.oie.int/en/what-we-do/global-initiatives/antimicrobial-resistance/#ui-id-4">OIE</a> have also developed lists of antibiotics that are considered of “critical importance” for human and animal medicine. These lists help establish priorities for antimicrobial resistance surveillance and new drug development.</p>
