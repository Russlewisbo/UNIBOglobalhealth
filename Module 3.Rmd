## COVID-19 Vaccine Access in Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) {.unnumbered}

In Module 2 we examined the crises in antibiotic development including its impact on low-middle income countries (LMICs). We also highlighted special challenges related to antibiotic access in countries where healthcare resources are limited. In this module we will further explore the problems and strategies for improving antibiotic, vaccine and diagnostic testing access in LMICs. We will explore successful models that have been used in the past for MDR tuberculosis and HIV antiviral medications to see if these approaches can be adapted to antimicrobial therapy.

However, at the time of the lesson we are in the midst a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections. Therefore, it is worth considering where we stand at the moment worldwide with vaccinations.

According to the WHO, over 11 billion must be vaccinated against COVID-19. As of December, 57.4% of the world population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Over 8.99 billion doses have been administered globally, and 33.05 million are now administered each day. Ten countries account for 77% of the globally administered doses. The market has been cornered by rich nations. The EU, the UK, and the USA have all purchased far more vaccine than they can possibly use. Only 8.3% of people in LMICs have received at least one dose of COVID-19.

### COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Program {.unnumbered}

The COVAX program was a group purchasing program that combines high-income and low-middle-income countries. The program is based on the idea that the world would unite and buy vaccines together, with high- and middle-income countries paying for themselves and low-middle-income countries receiving subsidized doses. Once vaccines are licensed and pre-qualified by the WHO, COVAX funds then pay for the purchase of doses for all 92 eligible countries. The guarantees are designed to incentivise manufacturers to ensure that enough doses are produced for LMIC economies, which collectively represent almost half the world's population.

-   HIC countries make higher contributions up-front in order to establish the funding to get manufacturing capacity in place. While it is not expected that they will rely on the the program to receive vaccine, it represents and insurance (back-up) if other negotiated channels of vaccine distribution fall-through

-   Doses for lower-income economies will also be procured through the COVAX Facility but will be paid for via the separate financial mechanism of the COVAX, which will be largely funded through Official Development Assistance (ODA), as well as contributions from the private sector and philanthropy. Even so, it is likely that the 92 ODA-eligible countries accessing vaccines through the COVAX AMC may also be required to share some of the costs of COVID-19 vaccines and delivery. Through this cost-sharing approach, countries will have an opportunity to complement and build on the essential foundation built by these early, donor funded doses if they wish to achieve a higher population coverage.

-   To help each economy, Gavi is providing up to US$ 150 million in initial funding to jumpstart support for COVAX -eligible country readiness in preparation for COVID-19 vaccines delivery, in the form of planning, technical assistance and cold chain equipment. In addition to this, the Alliance has developed a number of tools to help countries prepare, including the Country Readiness Assessment tool. This will enable each country to develop a national vaccination deployment plan, to assess their capacity for vaccine storage and distribution, and, in the context of the infodemic of misinformation about vaccine safety we are experiencing, help them prepare a comprehensive communication plan, to ensure people understand why COVID-19 vaccination is so important and who will get priority.

-   **The initial goal was to vaccinate 20% of the population in LMICs by the end of 2021** Though COVAX promised 100 million doses by the end of March, this goal was not reached until 6 July. By mid-August of 2021, COVAX delivered 200 million vaccine doses to nearly 140 countries instead of the 600 million doses initially projected. **Currently, it is estimated that less than 6% of population of sub-Saharan Africa are vaccinated against COVID-19.**

-  A major source of the vaccines for the COVAX program was the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine that through licensing agreements was being manufactured in part by the Serum Institute in India. However, when a third wave of COVID-19 hit India, over  400 million doses of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine doses was diverted for domestic use in India. COVAX has had to contend with a number of severe challenges, including supply bottlenecks and continued vaccine nationalism that have prevented it from being able to access doses as quickly as possible.

High-income countries also did not+ ultimately did not surrender their negotiating power to international organizations in Geneva. So they bought as many doses as they could for themselves and donated money to COVAX to buy doses for poor nations. By combining resources, the fund guarantees specific manufacturers for vaccine candidates a number of sales before they are licensed, as well as provide market-wide demand guarantees to all manufacturers in the longer term.


What has gone wrong? A fundamental challenge that has to be overcome is that HICs produce vaccines, invest in research development, and secure the supplies. This shuts the rest of the world out of the market. Africa consumes 25% of the world's vaccines, but do not manufacture any of them.

**What is Gavi?** By the late 1990s, the progress of international immunisation programmes was stalling. Nearly 30 million children in developing countries were not fully immunised against deadly diseases, and many others went without any immunisation at all. At the heart of the challenge was an acute market failure; powerful new vaccines were becoming available, but lower-income countries simply could not afford most vaccines. In response, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and a group of founding partners brought to life an elegant solution to encourage manufacturers to lower vaccine prices for the poorest countries in return for long-term, high-volume and predictable demand from those countries. In 2000, that breakthrough idea became the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation -- today Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Gavi now vaccinates almost half of the world’s children, giving it tremendous power to negotiate vaccines at prices that are affordable for the poorest countries and to remove the commercial risks that previously kept manufacturers from serving them.Because of these market shaping efforts, the cost of fully immunising a child with all 11 WHO-recommended childhood vaccines now costs about US$ 28 in Gavi-supported countries, compared with approximately US$ 1,200 in the United States of America. At the same time, the pool of manufacturers producing prequalified Gavi-supported vaccines has grown from to 18 in 2020 (with more than half based in Africa, Asia and Latin America).

Gavi shares the cost that implementing countries pay for vaccines, which has resulted in more than 495 vaccine introductions and campaigns, dramatically boosting immunisation against virulent diseases. For example, 3% of low-income countries had introduced nationally _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib) vaccine that protects against diseases like pneumonia and meningitis. Today, Gavi has enabled all low-income countries to introduce this vaccine in their national programmes. Progress on the third dose of Hib vaccine coverage, as well as with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), has been so successful that the coverage rate in Gavi-supported countries is now higher than the global average coverage rate. By the end of 2019, 16 countries had transitioned out of Gavi support and are fully financing all vaccine programmes introduced with Gavi support.
