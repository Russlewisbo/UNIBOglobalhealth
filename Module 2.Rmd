## The growing crises of antibiotic development {.unnumbered}

In module 1, we discussed the history of antibiotic discovery and the current challenges with antimicrobial resistance that has been amplified by the lack of development of new antibiotics. In this module, we will examine the scientific and economic challenges associated with antibiotic development, and compare and contrast strategies that have been proposed to stimulate development of new antibiotics.

As we discussed previously, antibiotic discovery began to slow in the 1980's leading to a discovery void in new molecular entities (NMEs) since the 1990s. This lack of antibiotic innovation occurred at a critical period when antibiotic resistance, particularly to many front-line beta-lactam antibiotics began to increase rapidly due to the emergence and worldwide diffusion of new forms of enzymatic (beta-lactamase) resistance to antibiotics. These bacterial enzymes can be broadly classified as:

-   Narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases, which act on penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins (e.g., TEM-1 and 2, SHV-1, cephalosporinases, OXA-type enzymes
-   Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), which act on penicillins and all four generations of cephalosporins (SHV-2, SHV-5, SHV-7, SHV-12, TEM-10, TEM-12, TEM-26, CTX-M, OXA-type ESBLs)
-   Carbapenemases, which act on penicillins, all four generations of cephalosporins, and carbapenems (KPC, NDM-1, VIM and IMP carbapenemases, OXA-type carbapenemases).

These beta-lactamases are problematic because they have a low barrier for creating resistance to multiple agents that are considered first and second line therapies of choice for common respiratory, abdominal, and genital-urinary tract infect infections. Indeed, single amino acid changes in the enzymes often can change their ability to hydrolyze new antibiotics. Additionally, many of these enzymes are encoded on spread on plasmids (mobile genetic elements that can be passed from one bacterial species to another) that harbour additional resistance mechanisms to other classes resulting in rapid dissemination of multidrug resistance.

As discussed in module 1, the WHO in 2017 convened a group of experts to prioritize the need for new drugs to treat antibiotic- resistant bacteria. The WHO assigned the highest priority to antibacterial drug research and development for the Gram- negative bacteria *Acinetobacter*, *Pseudomonas* and species of *Enterobacterales* that are resistant to carbapenems and are usually extensively drug resistant (XDR).

<br>The same year, the WHO released a [clinical pipeline report](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330420/9789240000193-eng.pdf), which was updated in 2018 and 2019. The clinical pipeline reports analysed antibiotics and biologics in development according to their activity against the critical priority pathogens carbapenem resistant *Acinetobacter baumannii* (CRAB), carbapenem-resistant *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* (CRPA), extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacterales and carbapenem resistant Enterobacterales (CRE). The level of innovation in the global clinical pipeline was assessed on the basis of the absence of pre-existing cross-resistance to currently used antibacterial drugs. The key findings from this report included:

<br>

> -   The clinical pipeline remains insufficient to tackle the challenge of increasing emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.
>
> -   It is primarily driven by small- or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with large pharmaceutical companies continuing to exit the field.
>
> -   Eight new antibacterial agents have been approved since 1 July 2017, but overall, they have limited clinical benefits.
>
> -   One new anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) agent, pretomanid, developed by a not-for-profit organization, has been approved for use within a set drug-combination treatment for MDR TB.
>
> -   The current clinical pipeline contains 50 antibiotics and combinations (with a new therapeutic entity) and 10 biologicals, of which 32 antibiotics are active against the WHO priority pathogens:
>
>     -   Six of these agents fulfil at least one of the innovation criteria; only two of these are active against the critical MDR Gram-negative bacteria.
>
>     -   More than 40% of the pipeline targeting WHO priority pathogens consists of additional β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor (BLI) combinations, with a major gap in activity against metallo-βlactamase (MBL) producers.
>
>     -   The anti-TB and C. difficile antibacterial pipeline is more innovative than the WHO priority pathogens pipeline, with more than half of the antibiotics fulfilling all of the innovation criteria.

The public health implications of a drying antibiotic pipeline are increasingly recognized by policymakers, regulators and many companies. in the following sections we will explore the causes and potential solutions to this crises.

## Why has antibiotic discovery faltered in recent years? {.unnumbered}

### Scientific challenges {.unnumbered}

Antibiotic discovery is particularly challenging. Antibiotics must attack multiple target species that change over time, by developing resistance, and must do this in multiple body compartments. [@LivermoreEtAl2011] The discoverer of a new antibiotic must guess what resistance problems will be a problem in 10 years, and bring drugs to market to overcome these challenges. This flexibility and risk is not encountered in other therapeutic areas such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperglycemia, or Alzheimer's disease where the drugs bind to one specific target. Even for cancer chemotherapy, which develops resistance to therapy, the mechanisms causing resistance are not transmissible to other cancers or patients. Antibiotics must also be remarkabley non-toxic, as their daily dosages often measured in grams are often higher that for other pharmaceutics measured in milligrams.

Nearly all of the antibiotics used today belong to classes of drugs discovered before 1970. They are products of a "golden age" of discovery from 1945-1965, which screened natural products from soil streptomyces and fungi. This discovery approach hit the law of diminishing returns by the 1960's with the same classes being repeatably rediscovered.[@LivermoreEtAl2011] Out simply, the *low-hanging* fruit for new antibiotic discovery has already been picked. Since 1970, the only new antibiotic classes to reach the marked are the oxazolidinones (i.e. linezolid discovered in 1978 launched in 2000) and lipopeptides (discovered in 1986 launched in 2003).

Most advances in antibiotics since the 1970s have come through improvements of existing antibiotic classes yielding analogues with increased potency and greater ability to evade existing resistance. However, over time this approach has become more difficult with the emergence of resistance given resistance to the entire class of antibiotics such as KPC carbapenemases that compromises nearly all beta-lactams, 16srRNA methylases that impact all aminoglycosides, and up-regulation of efflux pumps that affects multiple antibiotics classes.

Given the the limits of existing antibiotic classes had already been discovered by screening soil organisms, the pharmaceutical industry turned to genomics-based high-throughput antibiotic discovery strategies with considerable enthusiams in the 1990s.[@LivermoreEtAl2011] This discovery strategy used genomic sequence data from several target bacterial pathogens pathogens to identify conserved genes encoding targets not found in mammalian cells, and then run high-throughput screens of existing compound libraries to identify "druggable" molecules for these targets. Natural product screening was abandoned, partly because it had ceased to identify new leads, and was considered too expensive and time consuming and not easily adapted to the changing logistics of high-throughput drug screening.

Despiteearly enthusiasm and huge financial investments by many pharmaceutical companies, very few potential new antibiotic targets were identified and even fewer drugs entered into clinical development. An example of the scientific challenge is illustrated by experience of SmithKline Beecham (later purchased by Glaxo Smith Kline-one of the few large pharmaceutical companies still involved in antibiotic discovery (inset box)

From 1995 to 2002, SmithKline Beecham (now part of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) identified 300 potential targets and ran 67 high-throughput screens, each of 260,000 -- 530,000 compounds.[@PayneEtAl2007] Sixteen screens led to 'hits'---meaning compounds that bound selectively to a target giving a reproducible antimicrobial activity in assays---and five of these translated into 'lead' compounds. The five corresponding targets, two (FabI9and Mrs) were not universally essential or conserved, meaning that they could not form the targets of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and it proved impossible to incorporate 'drug-like properties' into molecules that bound two others. The final target identified was peptide deformylase, for which GSK now has a molecule (GSK 1322322) in Phase II trials, although this did not come from high-throughput screening. This performance appears typical of other companies that followed the genomics strategy. Thus, 20 years after its advent, no antibiotic developed by this approach has reached the market

### Antibiotic regulatory hurdles {.unnumbered}

The goal of regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the African Medicines Agency (AMA) is always the same: Balance potential benefits and risks to ensure that the antiibotics that make it to market are both safe and effective for patients in need. Still, a drug that gains FDA approval may give pause to European reviewers, despite having reviewed the same evidence as their American counterparts, and vice versa. Both the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/media/82381/download) and the [EMA](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/laboratory-patient-journey-centrally-authorised-medicine_en.pdf) and [AMA](https://www.ifpma.org/subtopics/african-medicines-agency/) have distinct processes with different methods of endpoint evaluation, and individual comfort levels with risk. Other countries, such as [India](https://cdsco.gov.in/opencms/opencms/en/Drugs/New-Drugs/) and [China](https://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/view/regulatory-requirements-and-key-points-drug-clinical-trials-registration-china) have their own processes for drug registration and approval and may require additional studies in populations of patients from their countries prior to approval. The FDA is unique in that before phased clinical trials can begin, drug sponsors are required to submit an investigational new drug application to the FDA that outlines initial animal testing results, the drug's composition and manufacturing, and the plan for testing the drug in humans.

</figure>

Current guidance published by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) requires randomized controlled clinical studies to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the new antibiotic to established therapies. This has to be complemented by the enrolment of a large number of patients to support the marketing application (New Drug Application NDA or Marketing Authorization Application MAA, respectively) for 1 or more infection site--specific indication (e.g., complicated urinary tract infection \[cUTI\] or complicated intra-abdominal infection), based on the drug's clinical efficacy and safety. The bacterial pathogens relevant to the indication listed in the prescribing information are a *secondary consideration* based on the spectrum of activity of the investigational antibiotic and the microbiological efficacy data extracted from the clinical trials.[@EcholsEtAl2019a] As a result, even if a new antibiotic is developed for a MDR pathogen, it is difficult to perform clinical studies and receive approval from the FDA or EMA for the treatment of a resistant infection.

However, lowering standards is not a reasonable path for science-based agencies; a race to the bottom will not fix this crisis.

A 2017 estimate puts the cost of developing an antibiotic at around US\$1.5 billion. Meanwhile, industry analysts estimate that the average revenue generated from an antibiotic's sale is roughly \$46 million per year.[@WoutersEtAl2020]. Therefore a key problem for antibiotics is that their development is not profitable. Companies are making so much more money from the sales of other drug classes, including immuno-oncology therapeutics, that antibiotic development projects compare poorly when management allocates capital. It is difficult for an antibiotic manufacturer to be able to precisely identify the small proportion of patients who both really need the antibiotic for a MDR pathogen and are willing to pay a high price for the drug. As noted by Ardal and colleges:[@ArdalEtAl2020a]

> The major challenge with antibiotics is profitability. As older antibiotics are still effective for treating most infections, the primary value of new antibiotics is to treat multidrug-resistant infections and provide a protective benefit against emerging pathogens. The duration of antibiotic treatment for individual patients is relatively short (for example, 1--2 weeks or up to 1 month), whereas the treatment for chronic conditions can be continuous over many years. Resistance is hastened by use, new antibiotics are stewarded as a last resort, which results in low unit sales. Whereas medicines for rare diseases have used high unit-pricing strategies to achieve profitability, these are often unavailable to antibiotic developers due to clinical trial design (it is difficult to demonstrate the superiority of new antibiotics as resistance is still relatively uncommon) and bundled hospital reimbursement structures (whereby hospitals are incentivized to prescribe lower-cost antibiotics). Large pharmaceutical companies have largely abandoned the market, accounting for only 4 of the 42 antibiotics currently under development.[@Mullard2019]Any investment in a new antibiotic is seen as a high-risk proposition, and consequently the returns expected by prospective investors are high to account for this risk premium. This in turn puts pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as there is little chance that their candidate antibiotics will be purchased by larger companies.

#### Who is still developing antibiotics?

### Economic challenges {.unnumbered}

Due to the threat of the emergence of resistance, new antibiotics are 'kept on the shelf ', not being sold. In no other drug class do we lock up the most innovative new products to keep sales as low as possible. Large companies have been making entirely rational decisions to exit this market, at least from the perspective of the individual company. For society, these individual commercial decisions threaten the global ability to research, develop and produce new antibiotics. We are destroying a key global infrastructure and threatening our health security

The era of purely private investment in new antibiotics seems to be coming to a close, and what we see now are co-investments by the public and private sectors, with publicly financed investors such as the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X) and the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP) occupying the centre stage in antibiotic development all the way from preclinical and regulatory stages to product registration.

### Economic strategies? {.unnumbered}

Incentives for antibiotics are categorized as either 'push' or 'pull'. Push incentives occur before regulatory approval by the FDA or European Medicines Agency, and the funding supports many projects, including the many that fail before approval. Pull incentives are paid only after regulatory approval and hence only successful products are supported. Both push and pull incentives are required to address our pressing problems.
