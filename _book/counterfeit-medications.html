<h2>Counterfeit Medications</h2>
<p>What is a fake medicine?</p>
<p>Interpol defines a counterfeit or substandard medicine as one that differs from the authentic version of the vaccine by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Containing too much or too little of one or more ingredients, or containing different ingredients</p></li>
<li><p>Claiming to have different properties or side effects</p></li>
<li><p>Having a different shape, size, taste, or colour</p></li>
<li><p>Being not correctly labelled or not labelled at all</p></li>
<li><p>Having an out-of-date or missing expiry date</p></li>
<li><p>Not including information on how to store the medicine</p></li>
<li><p>Having packaging that looks poorly constructed, is labelled with spelling or grammar errors, or appears to have been interfered with</p></li>
</ul>
<p>WHO estimates that up to 1% of medicines available in HICs. In LMICs, <strong>1 in 10 medicines are thought to be either substandard or falsified</strong>. Nearly 170,000 children die annually of falsified pneumonia medicines. Substandard or fake anti-malarial medications are estimated to cause 116,000 deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa. The limited data available on this issue means the known figures almost certainly represent just a fraction of the true burden of falsified medicines around the globe.</p>
<p><strong>Antibiotics are the most counterfeited medicines and account for 28% of counterfeit medicines globally.</strong><span class="citation"><sup>42</sup></span> Over 75% of counterfeit antibiotics come from South-East Asia and their destination is mainly emerging countries (South-East Asia: 44%; sub-Saharan Africa: 30%; Europe, North America: 9%; others: 16%). Counterfeit antibiotics are antibiotics that have been commonly used for years (beta-lactams: 50%; quinolones: 12%; macrolides, lincosamides, and synergistins: 1%; cyclins: 7%; others: 20%). The main counterfeit formulations are oral medications (77%) whereas injected drugs account for only 17% of counterfeit formulations, and eye drops and ointments 6%.</p>
<p>According to a report by the Medicine Quality Research Group, Centre of Tropical Medicine &amp; Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine and the University of Oxford, the black market in fake medicines grew by more than 400%.<span class="citation"><sup>43</sup></span> <strong>There is a growing online trend of fake websites that mimic real pharmaceutical websites where COVID-19 vaccines are sold up to $1000 and vaccine certificates for $200.</strong> Moreover, the “trickle down” of vaccine donations from richer countries has left populations, and particularly health worker in LMICs, vulnerable to infection with some turning to unlicensed vendors for vaccines.</p>
<p>WHO has warned that the vaccine equity gap continues to be exploited by organised criminal groups for profit as they pivot from personal protective equipment and diagnostics towards vaccines. Given that fake vaccine cards and passports are becoming a profitable business, authorities have urge citizens not to share photos of them on social media. Therefore, the importance of improved equitable vaccine roll-out becomes even more critical to protect poorer countries against the proliferation of falsified medicines.</p>
<p>The globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry has made tracking fake and substandard products more challenging.<span class="citation"><sup>44</sup></span> Active drug ingredients may come from China, while the product may be manufactured in India and be packaged in a third country before being shipped through Dubai. It might then be repackaged and shipped to yet another country to take advantage of exchange rates. These many steps provide more opportunities for fraud than if all manufacturing and packaging occurred ina single country where the process could be inspected and traced.</p>

<p>Counterfeit drugs are manufactured in countries which cannot guarantee good purchase practices and which have either too few or no regulation for distribution circuits. The lack of control, or their lax security or non-effectiveness, support the distribution of counterfeit drugs in national or illegal distribution circuits. This weakness is enhanced by the insufficiency of human and financial resources dedicated to control activities.<span class="citation"><sup>45</sup></span> Even if the pharmaceutical industry massively invests in the research of tools or technologies for the prevention and detection of counterfeit drugs, international collaboration required to guarantee the application and the development of such mechanisms is often lacking.</p>
<p>The legal systems of most countries do not take into account the public health issue of counterfeit drugs and the crime is punished as a similar level as counterfeiting of luxury goods, as laws having been conceived more to protect brands. Thus, the penalty for counterfeiting a t-shirt infringing intellectual property is 10 years, whereas it can be only one year for counterfeiting a drug. According to The International Drug Industry Federation, the counterfeit drug market is 25 times more lucrative for counterfeiters than that of heroin and 5 times more than that of cigarettes, with substantially lower criminal penalties for perpetrators who are caught.</p>
<p><strong>How to spot a counterfeit medicine according to Interpol: looking for the “six Ps” is a starting point to identify a falsified medical product:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Place</strong>—Never buy medicines from unknown websites or in a marketplace. If you are unsure about a supplier’s credentials, check the list of registered dispensaries at your local health regulatory body •</li>
<li><strong>Prescriptions</strong>—Only buy medicine that has been prescribed by your doctor or healthcare professional. When buying online, make sure the website requires you to present a prescription. Do not buy from websites that offer prescriptions on the basis of questionnaires or do not have a contactable pharmacist</li>
<li><strong>Promises</strong>—Be wary of pharmacies that offer “too good to be true” promises. False promises to watch out for are “cures all types” of a major illness, “money-back guarantee”, “no risk”, or “limited supply—buy in advance”</li>
<li><strong>Price</strong>—Check the price against products you usually buy or with reputable providers. If it is substantially cheaper, it is likely to be a fake</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong>—The trade in fake medical products has been linked to credit card fraud and identity theft. Do not reveal any personal information beyond appropriate medical details</li>
<li><strong>Product</strong>—Compare the medicines with your usual prescription</li>

<h3>Specific problems with counterfeited antibiotics</h3>
<p>Counterfeit drugs are often commonly “old” antibiotics such as beta-lactams, tetracycline, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol; the latest generations are rarely counterfeited. Most of the antibiotics counterfeited are on the WHO essential drugs list. The most common types of counterfeiting include:<span class="citation"><sup>45</sup></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Counterfeits without active ingredient (most common)</strong>. The active ingredient is replaced by cheap substances such as flour in the oral formulations. or injectable presentations.</li>
<li><strong>Bad quality counterfeits.</strong> They medicine may contain excipients or active ingredients un-adapted for the drug. These products may contain toxic or pathogenic chemical impurities. For example, counterfeit injectables have been found to contain methanol, a potentially lethal product for humans at low doses.</li>
<li><strong>Counterfeits with inadequate active ingredient.</strong> These concern real drugs, less expensive or outdated, first collected, opened, then repacked. It works both ways; an antibiotic may be replaced by the active ingredient of another class and vice versa. For example, in Nigeria, a counterfeiter had reconditioned diazepam syrup (benzodiazepine) and had sold it asan antibiotic under the original name of co-trimoxazole</li>
<li><strong>Counterfeit packaging.</strong> The counterfeiting may be made at various levels. False representation of identity is commonly used, either partially or totally by copying the packaging of another marketed product. The brand name may be modified to try to escape laws on infringing intellectual property</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking counterfeit antibiotics may induce adverse effects because of a different active ingredient or because of potentially toxic chemical ingredients or de pathogenic contaminant.<strong>The counterfeiting of antibiotics directly promotes the emergence of acquired bacterial resistance against antibiotics.</strong></p>

<p>The day Victoria Amponsah was diagnosed with malaria she also learned that she was two months pregnant. She left the hospital with a prescription for an anti-malarial drug and, like patients anywhere else in the world, went to a local pharmacy believing that the medicine she purchased would treat her condition. Victoria bought what she thought was a genuine, effective drug, but that was not the case. Her condition quickly worsened and within hours she was admitted to the hospital, learning later that she had been sold counterfeit pills.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Victoria and her baby survived the trauma and successfully fought off malaria, but this would not be her only personal encounter with fake medicine. At the end of her healthy pregnancy, she was deceived by a fake version of oxytocin, disguised in an official-looking package. Within thirty minutes, Victoria started sweating, shaking, vomiting and bleeding. She was in the hospital for two days, nearly lost her baby and had to return to the hospital every week after the incident for some time.</p>
<p>As Victoria knows all too well, fake medicine can threaten your health or even claim your life. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 700,000 people die every year from fake malaria and tuberculosis drugs alone. The WHO also estimates that 25-60% of the medicine supply in developing countries is either substandard or counterfeit. To wathc a video describing Victoria’s story, see the following YouTubeVideo produced the US Pharmacopia: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AMOn00dQsU&amp;t=64s" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AMOn00dQsU&amp;t=64s</a></p>

<h3>How can drug counterfeiting be reduced?</h3>
<p>The International Medical Products Anti-Counterfeiting Taskforce was created in 2006 by the WHO with the objectives of preventing the manufacture and the sale of counterfeit drugs, and to facilitate communication and collaboration between all the partners to coordinate the actions implemented to monitor and eliminate drug counterfeiting. The group has worked in 4 areas to address drug counterfeiting:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Development of guidance documents for principles and elements to include in national laws against the counterfeiting of medical product.</li>
<li>Implementation of regulations. It gives advice to national authorities to improve controls, tools for national evaluation, and models of procedures to deal with counterfeit drugs.</li>
<li>Training of personnel in charge of control of drug counterfeiting and collaboration between the various authorities of each country. For example, <a href="https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2010/INTERPOL-applauds-Southeast-Asia-Operation-Storm-II-s-success-in-disrupting-trade-of-counterfeit-medical-products">Operation Storm II</a> was coordinated by Interpol and the West-Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) of the WHO The platform improved collaboration between the police, the customs, and the drug regulatory authorities of international organizations and private sector. This operation led to 30 arrests and confiscating 12 million counterfeit drugs, including antibiotics, between July and November 2009. This action also led to closing 100 illicit pharmacies and sales points.</li>
<li>Development of technology for tracking and monitoring antibiotic prescriptions to ensure authenticity.</li>
<li>Improving health-care provider and patient awareness. created model supports to sensitize healthcare professionals and patients about warning signs and risks of counterfeit medications.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In 2019, The European Medicines Agency instituted new regulations for drug supply chain traceability and verification systems-“track and trace” to mitigate the risk of shortages and fight production and marketing of counterfeit drugs.</strong> The regulation also required new safety features (a unique identifier both in human readable format and encoded in 2D data matrix (such as RFID barcodes, holograms) as well as an anti-tampering devices to be placed on individual packs of virtually all prescription medicines, and related compliance reporting.</p>
<p>The European Council also set up the international convention Medicrime. This convention was adopted by the European Council on December 8, 2010, and signed on October 28, 2011. It prosecutes the counterfeiting of medical products and is thus the first specificudicial instrument in the domain of penal law for counterfeiting medications.</p>
<p>In some African countries, counterfeiting is a commercial crime but only penalized by a small fine. In India, counterfeiters can be sentenced to of 3 years of prison at most and a 108 dollar fine. But in China, counterfeiters can be sentenced to death. The implementation of inspection groups and the deployment of a prevention force allow detecting more effectively counterfeiters and dismantling the various counterfeiter networks. Among the various available prevention forces, customs are the most involved and responsible for 90% of confiscation of all kinds of counterfeiting in Europe and 70% worldwide</p>
<p>The counterfeiting of drugs, and especially that of antibiotics is a true public health issue.</p>
