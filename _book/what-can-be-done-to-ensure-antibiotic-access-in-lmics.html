<p>Individuals living in poverty are susceptible to infections and lack of access to basic sanitation facilities or adequate health care allows infections spread faster. Antibiotics, which may be available without prescription, are often used as substitutes for clean food, clean water, vaccines and diagnostics. Therefore, it will be impossible to address the challenges of antimicrobial resistance and lack of access to antibiotic therapy if other contributing factors are not addressed.</p>
<p><strong>For countries where antibiotics can be accessed without a prescription, controlling antibiotic distribution should be highly prioritized.</strong> However, introduction of a new prescription system when antibiotic demand is still high can lead to unintentional consequences (such as the distribution of antibiotics on the black market) that are even harder to control. It is important to note that the overuse of antibiotics has become a social norm in many countries as it is influenced by the beliefs and attitudes of the individuals towards antibiotics as well as sociocultural factors, regardless of medical justifications.<span class="citation"><sup>14</sup></span></p>
<p>Antibiotic use is generally higher in the developed world, but LMICs are rapidly catching up as access to healthcare improves and the burden of antibiotic-treatable infections remains high. Between 2000 and 2015, the global rate of antibiotic consumption increased by 39%, from 11.3 to 15.7 defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1,000 inhabitants per day. In LMICs, the consumption rate for cephalosporins, quinolones, and macrolides has increased by 399%, 125%, and 119%, respectively, while in high-income countries (HICs), consumption has decreased by 18%, 1%, and 25%, respectively.</p>

<div class="blue">
<p>Defined daily dose (DDD) is an index of drug consumption, defined by the World Health Organization, used to facilitate the comparison of drug usage between different drugs or between different health care environments. DDD is calculated by multiplying the quantity field by the DDD conversion factor field. In this example, the strength of one tablet is 500 mg and the ATC/DDD is 1 g for ciprofloxacin. Each 500 mg tablet is equivalent to 0.5 DDD.</p>
</div>
<p><br> In an analysis by the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics &amp; Policy (CDDEP),<span class="citation"><sup>15</sup></span> three key barriers in LMICs were identified that affect access to newer antibiotics for resistant pathogens:</p>
<div id="barrier-1-weak-drug-discovery-difficulties-in-market-entry-and-poor-stewardship-lead-to-irrational-selection-and-use-of-antibiotics" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Barrier 1: Weak drug discovery, difficulties in market entry, and poor stewardship lead to irrational selection and use of antibiotics</h3>
<p>Incentives for the sale of antibiotics promote inappropriate use, and conflicts of interest arise when the sale of medicines is not separated from the remuneration of hospitals and prescribers. For example, in China, hospitals derive significant revenues from the sale of antibiotics, and consequently, antibiotics are prescribed widely and inappropriately. For example, a hospital may receive a higher payment for treating an infection with a carbapenem versus and aminopenicllin, irrespective of the susceptibility of the pathogen. Marketers with unrestricted access to healthcare providers in LMICs can influence prescribing. In Uganda, doctors can receive financial incentives for prescribing specific brands or using a specific pharmacy. Many doctors have a financial interest in private pharmacies and prescribe more expensive antibiotics even when unnecessary. Promoters from pharmaceutical companies encourage doctors to prescribe multiple medications simultaneously and have unregulated access to doctors and pharmacists.</p>
<p>In India, direct and indirect gifts from medical representatives and commissions influence prescribing practices, and hospitals profit from sales. Doctors feel perceived or real pressure from patients, who, if unsatisfied, may change doctors. Doctors may prescribe for shorter durations than the recommended course of treatment to ensure that the patient returns. Prescribers may prefer to prescribe injectable formulations to maximize their profits</p>
<p>Self-prescribing is common across LMICs. In Uganda, 41% of antibiotic sales are over-the-counter. Antibiotics are easily obtained without prescription, and patients may reuse old prescriptions to treat recurrent infections or avoid going to a doctor for infections they consider embarrassing. Moreover, non-professionals often prescribe or dispense antibiotics. Healthcare providers without formal training provide more than 70% of primary care in India. Only 58% of those referring to themselves as doctors in India’s cities have a medical degree; in rural areas the proportion is just 19%, and a third of ‘doctors’ have only a secondary school education. <br> <br></p>

<h3>Barrier 2: Antibiotics are not affordable for many in LMICs and government funding for health is low</h3>
<p>LMICs face constraints on public spending and have insufficient budgets for healthcare. In Uganda, interviewees indicated that just 8.9% of the national budget goes to health services and only 47% of essential medicine list drugs, including antibiotics, are purchased.<span class="citation"><sup>15</sup></span> Government spending on healthcare in India is 1.4% of gross domestic product and insurance coverage is poor. Public health facilities lack adequate medicine stocks, and antibiotic availability is 50% to 60% in some states</p>
<p>Although global supply shortages have affected even HICs, the immediate challenges in LMICs are often associated with supply chain management and budgets for medicines. When stockouts are used as an metric for analyzing the performance healthcare system, countries may have incentives to keep drugs in stock but not distribute them.<br> <br></p>

<h3>Barrier 3: Weak health systems, unreliable supply chains and poor quality control fail to deliver antibiotics to patients in need</h3>
<p>For many patients in LMICs, out-of-pocket payments for antibiotics either limit access or push people into poverty. In remote areas, transportation costs for patients and accompanying relatives can be substantial, in some cases exceeding 20% of medical costs. In rural Kenya, the main reason for not seeking treatment was “lack of cash.” “No drugs available” and “drugs are ineffective” were also stated as reasons.<br> <br></p>

<td>Ensure the quality of antibiotics, and strengthen pharmaceutical regulatory capacity</td>
<td>WHO, national and regional regulators, countries, pharmaceutical suppliers and manufacturers</td>
<td><p>WHO support and coordination, national and regional regulators could collaborate to support quality assurance and avoid duplication of effort across countries.</p>
<p>Rapid information exchange for pharmacovigilence, information on poor- quality suppliers, and sharing of best practices and innovation will help drive substandard and falsified antibiotics from the market.</p>
<p>An international entity, such as the WHO, could provide surveillance, monitoring, and compliance testing for antibiotic quality. Such work<br />
would support LMICs’ regulatory authorities and also ensure the integrity of the supply chain from the dominant suppliers in India and China. It could also establish standards for generic antibiotics and fixed-dose combinations, which are commonly used in LMICs, and support the industry in self- regulation.</p></td>

<td>Encourage local manufacturing for cost-effective antibiotics.</td>
<td>Countries, regional collaborations, pharmaceutical industry, including drug R&amp;D and manufacturers</td>
<td>Development and diversification of local manufacturers can help ensure the steady supply of essential, quality-assured antibiotics so that countries can meet their own needs. This should be supported through regional collaborations of countries such as the African Union.</td>
