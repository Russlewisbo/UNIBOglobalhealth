<h2>Why has antibiotic discovery faltered in recent years?</h2>
<div id="scientific-challenges" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Scientific challenges</h3>
<p>Antibiotic discovery is particularly challenging. Antibiotics must attack multiple target species that change over time, by developing resistance, and must do this in multiple body compartments.<span class="citation"><sup>2</sup></span> The discoverer of a new antibiotic must guess what resistance problems will be a problem in 10 years, and bring drugs to market to overcome these challenges. This flexibility and risk is not encountered in other therapeutic areas such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperglycemia, or Alzheimer’s disease where the drugs bind to one specific target. Even for cancer chemotherapy, which develops resistance to therapy, the mechanisms causing resistance are not transmissible to other cancers or patients. Antibiotics must also be remarkabley non-toxic, as their daily dosages often measured in grams are often higher that for other pharmaceutics measured in milligrams.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the antibiotics used today belong to classes of drugs discovered before 1970. They are products of a “golden age” of discovery from 1945-1965, which screened natural products from soil streptomyces and fungi. This discovery approach hit the law of diminishing returns by the 1960’s with the same classes being repeatably rediscovered.<span class="citation"><sup>2</sup></span> Since 1970, the only new antibiotic classes to reach the marked are the oxazolidinones (i.e. linezolid discovered in 1978 launched in 2000) and lipopeptides (discovered in 1986 launched in 2003).</p>
<p>Most advances in antibiotics since the 1970s have come through improvements of existing antibiotic classes yielding analogues with increased potency and greater ability to evade existing resistance. However, over time this approach has become more difficult with the emergence of resistance given resistance to the entire class of antibiotics such as KPC carbapenemases that compromises nearly all beta-lactams, 16srRNA methylases that impact all aminoglycosides, and up-regulation of efflux pumps that affects multiple antibiotics classes.</p>
<p>Given the the limits of existing antibiotic classes had already been discovered by screening soil organisms, the pharmaceutical industry turned to genomics-based high-throughput antibiotic discovery strategies with considerable enthusiams in the 1990s.<span class="citation"><sup>2</sup></span> This discovery strategy used genomic sequence data from several target bacterial pathogens pathogens to identify conserved genes encoding targets not found in mammalian cells, and then run high-throughput screens of existing compound libraries to identify “druggable” molecules for these targets. Natural product screening was abandoned, partly because it had ceased to identify new leads, and was considered too expensive and time consuming and not easily adapted to the changing logistics of high-throughput drug screening.</p>
<p>Despiteearly enthusiasm and huge financial investments by many pharmaceutical companies, very few potential new antibiotic targets were identified and even fewer drugs entered into clinical development. An example of the scientific challenge is illustrated by experience of SmithKline Beecham (later purchased by Glaxo Smith Kline-one of the few large pharmaceutical companies still involved in antibiotic discovery (inset box)</p>

<div class="blue">
<p>From 1995 to 2002, SmithKline Beecham (now part of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) identified 300 potential targets and ran 67 high-throughput screens, each of 260,000 – 530,000 compounds.<span class="citation"><sup>3</sup></span> Sixteen screens led to ‘hits’—meaning compounds that bound selectively to a target giving a reproducible antimicrobial activity in assays—and five of these translated into ‘lead’ compounds. The five corresponding targets, two (FabI9and Mrs) were not universally essential or conserved, meaning that they could not form the targets of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and it proved impossible to incorporate ‘drug-like properties’ into molecules that bound two others. The final target identified was peptide deformylase, for which GSK now has a molecule (GSK 1322322) in Phase II trials, although this did not come from high-throughput screening. This performance appears typical of other companies that followed the genomics strategy. Thus, 20 years after its advent, no antibiotic developed by this approach has reached the market</p>

<div id="antibiotic-regulatory-approval" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Antibiotic Regulatory approval</h3>
<p>The goal of regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the African Medicines Agency (AMA) is always the same: Balance potential benefits and risks to ensure that the antiibotics that make it to market are both safe and effective for patients in need. Still, a drug that gains FDA approval may give pause to European reviewers, despite having reviewed the same evidence as their American counterparts, and vice versa. Both the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/82381/download">FDA</a> and the <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/laboratory-patient-journey-centrally-authorised-medicine_en.pdf">EMA</a> and <a href="https://www.ifpma.org/subtopics/african-medicines-agency/">AMA</a> have distinct processes with different methods of endpoint evaluation, and individual comfort levels with risk. Other countries, such as <a href="https://cdsco.gov.in/opencms/opencms/en/Drugs/New-Drugs/">India</a> and <a href="https://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/view/regulatory-requirements-and-key-points-drug-clinical-trials-registration-china">China</a> have their own processes for drug registration and approval and may require additional studies in populations of patients from their countries prior to approval. The FDA is unique in that before phased clinical trials can begin, drug sponsors are required to submit an investigational new drug application to the FDA that outlines initial animal testing results, the drug’s composition and manufacturing, and the plan for testing the drug in humans. The EMA follows a</p>
<p>Current guidance published by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) requires randomized controlled clinical studies to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the new antibiotic to established therapies. This has to be complemented by the enrolment of a large number of patients to support the marketing application (New Drug Application <span class="math display">\[NDA\]</span> or Marketing Authorization Application <span class="math display">\[MAA\]</span>, respectively) for 1 or more infection site–specific indication (e.g., complicated urinary tract infection <span class="math display">\[cUTI\]</span> or complicated intra-abdominal infection), based on the drug’s clinical efficacy and safety. The bacterial pathogens relevant to the indication listed in the prescribing information are a <em>secondary consideration</em> based on the spectrum of activity of the investigational antibiotic and the microbiological efficacy data extracted from the clinical trials.<span class="citation"><sup>4</sup></span> As a result, even if a new antibiotic is developed for a MDR pathogen, it is difficult to perform clinical studies and receive approval from the FDA or EMA for the treatment of a resistant infection.</p>
As a result, the cost of antibiotic development has become unsustainable.The estimated median capitalized research and development cost per product now likely exceeds 1 billion dollars.<span class="citation"><sup>5</sup></span>
