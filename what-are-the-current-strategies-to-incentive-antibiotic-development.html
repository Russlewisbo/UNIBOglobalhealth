<h2>What are the current strategies to incentive antibiotic development?</h2>
<p>Incentives for antibiotics are categorized as either ‘push’ or ‘pull’. Push incentives occur before regulatory approval by the FDA or EMA, and the funding supports many projects, including the many that fail before approval. Pull incentives are paid only after regulatory approval and hence only successful products are supported. Both push and pull incentives are required to address the lack of antibiotic development.</p>
<p>Many successful initiatives to establish push funding for antibiotics have been developed over the last decade. At present, the United States and the European Union have initiated a wide array of push incentives, including support of basic science at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the UK Medical Research Council, and other national funding agencies, as well as specialized support for preclinical and clinical antibacterial research by the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), <a href="https://carb-x.org/">CARB-X</a>, the <a href="https://www.imi.europa.eu/projects-results/project-factsheets/enable">European Gram Negative AntiBacterial Engine (ENABLE)</a>, the <a href="https://www.repair-impact-fund.com/">REPAIR Impact Fund</a> and the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership <a href="https://www.gardp.org/">GARDP</a>. Other important funding partners for push incentives have included the <a href="https://wellcome.org/">Wellcome Trust</a>, the <a href="https://www.imi.europa.eu/">Innovative Medicines Initiative</a> and the Novo Nordisk Foundation in Europe and <a href="https://www.amractionfund.com/">AMR Action Fund,</a> which is supported in part by the UK’s Global AMR Innovation Fund, European Investment Bank, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, among others.</p>
<p>These push efforts are creating hope. The preclinical pipeline is shifting to higher quality products targeting the most urgent clinical needs, de-risking projects for private development. Without these programmes, the fragile pipeline would become entirely moribund. However, the bankruptcy of Achaogen in April 2019 provided a wake-up clarity for the antibiotics industry: the finish line is not FDA or EMA approval, but break-even profitability. For Achaogen, scientific and regulatory achievement ended in economic disaster. A similar fate awaits other antibiotic companies unless governments enact meaningful pull incentives in the next year.</p>

<p>Pull incentives are increasing the focus of of new initiatives to develop antibiotics in the United States and Europe, building on the release of the <a href="http://drive-ab.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/DRIVE-AB-Final-Report-Jan2018.pdf">DRIVE-AB final report in 2018.</a> Clearly, effective pull funding will require substantial public investment that may not be politically popular if viewed as a large cash “handout” to pharmaceutical companies. Yet, some novel reimbursement schemes with pull incentives for antibiotic development are starting in the US, UK and Europe (recently reviewed by Gotham et al[<span class="citation"><sup>11</sup></span>). One of the most frequently discussed pull incentives is the “Netflix reimbursement model” that is currently being implemented as a pilot project in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-scheme-underway-to-tackle-amr-and-protect-uk-patients">UK</a> and <a href="https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/communicable-disease-control/antibiotics-and-antimicrobial-resistance/availability-of-antibiotics/">Sweden</a>. This payment mechanism is called <strong>‘de-linkage’ model</strong> because it delinks the payments to manufacturers from the number of units sold..</p>

<p>How can the <strong>true value</strong> of antibiotics be better communicated to the public? Two leading experts in antimicrobial resistance (Drs. John Rex and Ken Outterson) have suggested that antibiotics should be thought of more like the “fire-extinguishers” of medicine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No one wakes up hoping they get to use a fire extinguisher that day. Not even the fire department. Fire fighters go to work every day and hope they don’t get any calls. They perform regular maintenance on all their gear and stay at the station 24/7 just as a precaution. We pay them to be available and prepared so they can come to our rescue when we need them. If we didn’t pay for the fire department for years and then a fire broke out in the middle of your town, can you imagine the damage? People would die unnecessarily, the medical system would be overwhelmed, and the fire could spread beyond the borders of the town. The fire might rage through the whole county, then the region, and then your entire country. It might even spread through the entire world, just like COVID-19. <br> A fire fighter uses a hose to subdue flames engulfing a home while a physician uses antibiotics to stop an infection in your body. We need to be prepared for fires – the flame kind and the medical kind. As a society, we are prepared for the flame kind. But the medical? We aren’t even close. <br> Without antibiotics, all of modern medicine will change worldwide. Diseases we think of only being in the history books could become a part of every day life again. Minor surgery could become life threatening. An infected cut on your hand could be the end. Childbirth will easily endanger the lives of mothers and newborns. Cancer treatments will be nearly impossible. Antibiotics are vitally important to all of humanity”. <br> -<a href="https://amr.solutions/fire-extinguishers-of-medicine/">John Rex, M.D., AMR Solutions</a></p>

<p><strong>For further study:</strong> Tetraphase pharmaceuticals is a small company with a innovative and unique chemistry platform for developing novel tetracycline analogues that have activity against many MDR organisms on the WHO Priority Pathogens List. Their lead compound, eravacycline, was appoved by the FDA for the treatment of complicated intraabdominal infections in 2018. Like many of its peers, merely securing approval was only the first hurdle. What has happened since to everacycline and Tetraphase pharmaceuticals? How could a different reimbursement scheme changed outcomes?</p>

<div id="antibiotic-supply-chain-problems" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Antibiotic supply chain problems</h3>
<p>Although much of the focus on antibiotic availability is focused on new drugs for AMR, another worrying phenomenon is the increasing frequency of shortages of older generics, mostly injectable antibacterials, such as piperacillin-tazobactam or benzylpenicillin. Drug shortages are another factor that can contrinute to AMR.<span class="citation"><sup>12</sup></span> The fierce price competition combined with stringent production requirements for parenteral antibacterials has led to a significant reduction of suppliers, in particular of active pharmaceutical ingredients, and to highly optimized and thus more vulnerable supply chains. Increasingly prevalent shortages of even older antibiotics is now recognized as a major public health threat and requires additional specific action beyond.</p>
