<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Overview</h1>
<p>Until the 20th Century, influenza, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and enteric infections were the top three causes of death in Western countries. The average life expectancy of adults was less than 50 years, and 2% of children failed to live beyond 5 years of age with most deaths caused by communicable diseases. <br>Industrialization and growing wealth during the 19th century brought improvements in sanitation and drinking water resulting in improvements in life expectancy. By the early 20th century, advances in immunization led to the introduction of vaccines for pertussis, diptheria, yellow fever and tuberculosis. However, life-threatening bacterial infections remained an everyday threat to human health. Strep throat was sometimes a fatal infection, ear infections could lead to deafness, mastoiditis or meningitis with a 90% mortality rate, and surgery or childbirth was associated with high complication rates and frequent maternal deaths.</p>

<p><br>“Antibiotics” or products with antibiotic-like properties have been used for millennia to treat infections, although until the last century or so people did not know the infections were caused by bacteria. The first discovery and medical application of a synthetic drug for the treatment of bacterial infections is credited to Paul Erlich (1854-1915) for the use of arsphenamine (Salvarsan) in the treatment of syphilis. The serendipitous discovery of penicillin on September 3, 1928 by Alexander Fleming, and its subsequent purification of the drug in quantities needed for clinical testing by Florey and Chain in the late 1930s, however was the major breakthrough in antibiotic treatment for common infections. Alexander Fleming was also among the first physicians to caution about the risks of resistance to penicillin if used too little or for a too short of period during treatment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not difficult to make microbes resistant to penicillin in the laboratory by exposing them to concentrations not sufficient to kill them, and the same thing has occasionally happened in the body. The time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily under-dose himself and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug make them resistant. -Sir Alexander Fleming</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br> Fleming’s predictions were realized within a couple of years as the first cases of penicillin resistance reported in 1947. Thus an “arms race” began between antimicrobial resistance and the discovery of new antibiotics to treat new forms of antibiotic resistance. Initially, during 1950s-1980’s, antibioti discovery seemdd to keep pace with the emrgence of resistance. It was often possible to simply switch treatment once resistance against a specific antibiotic became a major problem. But then by the 1980’s antibiotic discovery began to slow. The latest discovery of a new antibiotic class that has reached the market was in 1987. Since then, there has been a lack of innovation in the field, and today there are few novel antibiotic classes in the drug pipeline. In Module 2 we will examine the scientific challenges and market forces that have made new antibiotic discovery increasingly difficult.</p>
<p><br> Once resistance has developed in a bacteria, it can spread from a colonised patient to another patient if appropriate hygienic precautions (e.g., hand hygiene, isolation) are not taken. The risk of resistant bacteria spreading is enhanced in crowded environments, especially when people in the surrounding area are receiving antibiotics - a common situation in hospitals and other healthcare facilities.</p>
<p><br> The consequences of faltering antibiotic discovery are now seen worldwide as more and more bacterial infections are becoming hard to treat once again. Especially worrisome is the lack of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria. The rapid global spread of multi- and pan-resistant bacteria, also known in the lay press as “superbugs,” can cause infections that are not treatable with existing antibiotics.</p>

<p><br> Recognizing the growing global threat of antibiotic resistance (AMR) on human health but also the economy and human development, The World Health Organization (WHO) and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) proposed as a <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241509763">Global Action Plan for AMR</a> in 2017. The plan outlines 21 strategies and 5 strategic objectives action plans that should be implemented in member states to address AMR. These include</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Improvements in the awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training</li>
<li>Strengthening of knowledge and evidence base of AMR through surveillance and research</li>
<li>Reductions in the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures</li>
<li>Optimization the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health</li>
<li>Development of an economic case for sustainable investment in AMR research that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions</li>
</ol>
<p>The WHO also published a <a href="https://www.who.int/medicines/publications/WHO-PPL-Short_Summary_25Feb-ET_NM_WHO.pdf">Priority Pathogen List</a> for research and development of new antibiotics. This priority list includes bacterial pathogens that are considered to be be the biggest threat to human health beyond <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis,</em>, which was previously listed as health priority pathogen for which innovative new treatments are urgently needed. The WHO list breaks down pathogens into three groups:</p>

<p><br> These pathogens may exhibit multi-drug resistance (MDR, resistance to one agent in at least 3 antibiotic categories), extensive drug resistance (XDR, non-susceptibility except to 2 or fewer antibiotic categories) or pan-drug resistance (PDR, non-susceptibility to all agents in all antibiotic categories <span class="citation">(1)</span>. Difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR) is a newer definition used to define isolate resistance patterns that require the use of less-effective or more toxic “reserve” agents- e.g., <em>Acinetobacter baumanii</em> susceptible only to colistin and tobramycin <span class="citation">(2)</span>.</p>
<p><br> Currently, both the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/312266/9789241515528-eng.pdf">WHO</a> and <a href="https://www.oie.int/en/what-we-do/global-initiatives/antimicrobial-resistance/#ui-id-4">OIE</a> have developed and updated lists of critical importance for human and animal health.</p>
